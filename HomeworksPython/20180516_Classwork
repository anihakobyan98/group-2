1. Verify whether dhclient is running.

/sbin/dhclient

2. Display your current ip address(es).
ifconfig

3. Display the configuration file where this ip address is defined.

cat /etc/network/interfaces

4. Follow the nic configuration in the book to change your ip address from dhcp client tofixe. Keep the same ip address to avoid conflicts!

vim /etc/network/interfaces

# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto  eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address   170.20.51.69
broadcast 10.42.189.207
netmask   255.255.255.240
gateway   170.20.51.1
                     
ifdown

5.  Did  you  also  configure  the  correct  
gateway
  in  the  previous  question  ?  If  not,  then  do
this now.
6. Verify that you have a gateway.

/sbin/route

7. Verify that you can connect to the gateway, that it is alive.

ping -c3 gateway

8. Change the last two digits of your mac address.

ifconfig enp2s0 | grep HWaddr
sudo ifconfig enp2s0 hw ether 00:42:42:42:42:42
ifconfig enp2s0 | grep HWaddr

9. Which ports are used by http, pop3, ssh, telnet, nntp and ftp ?

grep ^'http' /etc/services
grep ^'pop3' /etc/services
grep ^'ssh' /etc/services
grep ^'telnet' /etc/services
grep ^'nntp' /etc/services
grep ^'ftp' /etc/services

12. Which ip-addresses did your computer recently have contact with 

arp -a
